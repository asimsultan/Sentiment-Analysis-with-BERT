# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis with BERT project! This project focuses on classifying text as positive or negative sentiment using BERT.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in text, such as positive or negative. In this project, we leverage the power of BERT to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of text reviews.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of text reviews. You can create your own reviews and place them in the `data/sample_reviews.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bert_sentiment_analysis.git
cd bert_sentiment_analysis

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a CSV file with two columns: text and label.

# To fine-tune the BERT model for sentiment analysis, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/sample_reviews.csv

# To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/ --data_path data/sample_reviews.csv
